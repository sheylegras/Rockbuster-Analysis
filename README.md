# **Rockbuster-Analysis**
A SQL based project of a ficticuos online movie rental company as part of CareerFoundry Data Analysis immersion course.
## **Objective**
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that formally had stores around the world. Because of the stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the management team is planning to use our existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. In order to come up with a plan, we need to answer key business strategy questions using insights from the current data we have.
